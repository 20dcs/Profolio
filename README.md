Profolio is a customizable portfolio website template that allows users to easily create and host their own portfolio website. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with Profolio.

## Step 1: Fork the Template Repository

To get started, head over to the [Profolio GitHub repository](https://github.com/20dcs/Profolio) and fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

## Step 2: Replace the Data

After forking the repository, you'll need to replace the `data.json` file with your own personal data. To generate this data, visit [https://profoliomaker.netlify.app/](https://profoliomaker.netlify.app/) and fill in your details, just like making a resume.

Once you're finished, just copy the code that is generated and replace the existing `data.json` file in your forked repository.

Finally, you'll just need to host your portfolio website. Profolio is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), so you can easily host your website with any free hosting platform such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Just sign up on the platform, give it access of your github account and import your forked repository, it will be deployed on the internet. Once you've hosted your website on the internet, you can share a simple link to your portfolio and showcase your work to the world!

### That's it! With just three simple steps, you can create and host your very own professional portfolio website using Profolioâœ¨
