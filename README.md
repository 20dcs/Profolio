# ProFolio

Profolio is a customizable portfolio website template that allows users to easily create and host their own portfolio website. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with Profolio.

## Step 1: Fork the Template Repository

To get started, head over to the [Profolio GitHub repository](https://github.com/20dcs/Profolio) and fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

## Step 2: Replace the Data

After forking the repository, you'll need to replace the `data.json` file with your own personal data. To generate this data, visit [https://portfoliomaker.netlify.app/](https://portfoliomaker.netlify.app/) and fill in your details, just like making a resume. Once you're finished, just copy the code that is generated and replace the existing `data.json` file in your forked repository.

## Step 3: Host the Website

Finally, you'll need to host your portfolio website. Profolio is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), so you can easily host your website with any free hosting platform such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Once you've hosted your website, you can share a simple link to your portfolio and showcase your work to the world!

### That's it! With just three simple steps, you can create and host your very own professional portfolio website using Profolioâœ¨
